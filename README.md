# Equity-Behavior-Comparison

#The original file was created as a refresher for math and python skills, intended to brush up on old courses

#The scale of the project may increase, I'd like to link an API and have the user input be as simple as a timeframe and a ticker
#but that also limits how dynamic the program can be

#The next step to work on is using linear regression and the SKLearn module to graph predictive estimates of future cash flows

#This would also involve a visual representation of the standard deviation of cash flows for each quarter
